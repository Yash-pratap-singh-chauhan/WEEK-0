 Assignment 1, Jan 7, 2025
 Only problems 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 will be discussed in the tutorial.
 1. Given A ∈ Mn(F), show that A can be written uniquely as
 A=B+C
 where B is a symmetric matrix and C is a skew-symmetric matrix.
 2. Let A ∈ Mm,n(F), B ∈ Mn,p(F), C ∈ Mp,q(F). Show that
 • (AB)C =A(BC),
 • (AB)T =BTAT and (AB)∗ =B∗A∗.
 3. Let A,B ∈ Mm,n(R) such that Ax = Bx for all x ∈ Rn. Then prove that A = B.
 4. Let A be an upper-triangular matrix. If A∗A = AA∗ then prove that A is a diagonal matrix.
 A similar result holds if A is a lower-triangular matrix.
 5. A square matrix A ∈ Mn(F) is said to be nilpotent if Ak = 0 for some natural number k.
 • Give example of non-zero nilpotent matrices,
 • Prove that if A is nilpotent then A+In is an invertible matrix, where In is the identity
 matrix of order n.
 6. Let A ∈ Mn(C) be a Hermitian matrix i.e. A∗ = A.
 • Then the diagonal entries of A are necessarily real numbers.
 • For each B ∈ Mn(C) prove that B∗AB is a Hermitian matrix.
 • Further if A2 = 0 then show that A = 0.
 • Then x∗Ax is a real number, for any x ∈ Mn,1(C).
 7. Given a square matrix A ∈ Mn(F), the trace of A denoted by Tr(A), is defined to be the
 sum of all diagonal entries, i.e.,
 n
 Tr(A) :=
 i=1
 ai,i.
 • Let B ∈Mn(F), then show that Tr(AB) = Tr(BA)
 • Show that if A is invertible then Tr(ABA−1) = Tr(B)
